# Revive PDA

Revive PDA is a tool for [Torn City](https://www.torn.com/2068379) revivers to automatically find revive targets among given contracts. Your inputs are stored locally in your browser for convenience. This tool does not handle errors from the torn API, if you put in incorrect information you risk being temporarily timed out. The tool is built around inputting contracts from NUKE, but you can use it to scan any faction.

## Instructions

You must fill in your torn API key and submit at least one "contract", consisting of a faction ID (must be correct), name, and any options you want to use for the scan. For example, if you unselect "online", it will filter out anyone who is online.

## Issues

Please open an [Issue](https://github.com/e-fairy/RevivePDA/issues/new) or message/mail [Cute [2068379]](https://www.torn.com/profiles.php?XID=2068379) if you have any problems or want to make a suggestion. Keep in mind this was made as a personal tool for my own use and I'm not likely to make major changes, but I will try to fix any bugs.
